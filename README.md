# nix-setup
Configure Linux/MacOS (m1)

This is Steve Dake (https://github.com/sdake)'s configuration automation
for my desktops and servers. You may not want to run this directly as it
contains my custom philsophy for a desktop and shell environment.

The goal is repeatable GUI minimalism, with extensive functionality within the shell.
