# nix-setup
Configure Linux/MacOS (m1)

This is [Steve Dake](https://github.com/sdake)'s configuration automation
for desktops and servers. You may not want to run this directly as it
contains my custom philsophy for a desktop and shell environment.

The goal is repeatable GUI minimalism, with extensive functionality within the shell.

If you don't wear seatbelts, this command is for you:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdake/nix-setup/main/remote-install/seatbelts.sh | bash
```

Please be aware after running this tool, its hard to go back, because
the shell behaves like a modern shell should. Also things change, and
the prior state was not stored.
